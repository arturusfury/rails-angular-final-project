# RecipeBox - Rails/Angular Final Project

My final project for Flatiron School involved using Rails and Angular to create
a backend API that I could then consume with AngularJS to properly display the
information to users with a nice clean look.  My goal was to create an easy to
use website that contains tons of user submitted recipes while also allowing
users to submit a review of any existing recipe giving feedback for other users
as well as the recipe creator.

This project uses a variety of different assets such as the MaterializeCSS web
framework and several different Angular modules such as Angular Materialize,
Angular Password and UI Router.
